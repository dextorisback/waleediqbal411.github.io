excerpt: "Computer networking is a major research discipline in computer science, electrical engineering,
and computer engineering. The feld has been actively growing, in terms of both
research and development, for the past hundred years. This study uses the article content
and metadata of four important computer networking periodicals—IEEE Communications
Surveys and Tutorials (COMST), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON),
ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communications (SIGCOMM), and IEEE International
Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)—obtained using ACM,
IEEE Xplore, Scopus and CrossRef, for an 18-year period (2000–2017) to address important
bibliometrics questions. All of the venues are prestigious, yet they publish quite different
research. The frst two of these periodicals (COMST and TON) are highly reputed
journals of the felds while SIGCOMM and INFOCOM are considered top conferences of
the feld. SIGCOMM and INFOCOM publish new original research. TON has a similar
genre and publishes new original research as well as the extended versions of diferent
research published in the conferences such as SIGCOMM and INFOCOM, while COMST
publishes surveys and reviews (which not only summarize previous works but highlight
future research opportunities). In this study, we aim to track the co-evolution of trends in
the COMST and TON journals and compare them to the publication trends in INFOCOM
and SIGCOMM. Our analyses of the computer networking literature include: (a) metadata
analysis; (b) content-based analysis; and (c) citation analysis. In addition, we identify the
signifcant trends and the most infuential authors, institutes and countries, based on the
publication count as well as article citations. Through this study, we are proposing a methodology
and framework for performing a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on computer
networking research. To the best of our knowledge, no such study has been undertaken in
computer networking until now."
