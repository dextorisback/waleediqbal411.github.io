excerpt: "Teachers play a central role in education. However, there are many factors like non-teaching activities given to teachers besides the teaching workload, and the low or insufficient qualification of teachers, which can lower the quality of education imparted by teachers, especially in the developing countries. In this paper, we have proposed a volunteer based solution named "EDUCATION ASAAN" in Pakistan where volunteers will be placed with teachers of different public sector and private sector educational institutes to share the workload of teachers there, to complement the learning process as well as to improve the quality of education. The paper mentions semi-structured interviews from teachers to understand the kind of work burdens they face as well as their feedback on our proposed solution. We discuss the findings of different surveys conducted in different educational institute from different students and potential volunteers as well. With each of the feedback, the paper also tries to discuss the problems in different phases of selection, placement and evaluation of these volunteers and their possible solutions."

Abstract: Teachers play a central role in education. However, there are many factors like non-teaching activities given to teachers besides the teaching workload, and the low or insufficient qualification of teachers, which can lower the quality of education imparted by teachers, especially in the developing countries. In this paper, we have proposed a volunteer based solution named "EDUCATION ASAAN" in Pakistan where volunteers will be placed with teachers of different public sector and private sector educational institutes to share the workload of teachers there, to complement the learning process as well as to improve the quality of education. The paper mentions semi-structured interviews from teachers to understand the kind of work burdens they face as well as their feedback on our proposed solution. We discuss the findings of different surveys conducted in different educational institute from different students and potential volunteers as well. With each of the feedback, the paper also tries to discuss the problems in different phases of selection, placement and evaluation of these volunteers and their possible solutions.
