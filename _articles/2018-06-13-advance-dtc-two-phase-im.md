excerpt: "In this paper, a modified direct torque control (DTC) method for four-switch two-leg inverter, also known as B4 inverter, fed two-phase symmetrical induction motor is proposed. The presented technique shows a prospect of developing a similar DTC strategy of six-switch fed three-leg three-phase induction motor by emulation. With the help of suitable combinations of active intrinsic vectors of B4 inverter, enhanced torque dynamics as well as considerable reduction in torque ripple is achieved. Simulation results confirm the high performance of the proposed technique, which ultimately can very effectively be employed in automotive industry."

title: "A Chaos Based SVPWM technique for B4 Inverter fed Two-Phase Symmetric Induction Motor for THD & EMI improvement at Low Modulation Index"
category: articles
permalink: /articles/2019-07-02-chaotic-svpwm-two-phase-im
excerpt: "Based on chaos theory, a hybrid space vector pulse width modulation, Chaotic SVPWM, is proposed. The conventional SVPWM contains harmonic components with higher amplitudes around the switching frequency (fixed) whereas the proposed chaotic SVPWM is operated at chaotic period of the inverter thereby varying the switching frequency for the inverter. Because of this varying switching frequency, the peak value of harmonics got distributed over the output harmonics spectrum of the inverter, effectively suppressing the influence of harmonics and ultimately reducing the current/torque ripple of the induction motor. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is cost efficient, straightforward and can be used to suppress EMI characteristics of the inverter. The design methodology is based on a two-phase power system, but it can easily be extended for n-phase systems as well. The simulation is performed in MATLAB to validate this C-SVPWM control technique."
